# quickimm

Quickimm is an interactive and personalized service for potential or current international students. The purpose for the product is to pull information from several resources already available, and gather them in one central location. While an interested individual can research for these resources on their own, it is often difficult and confusing. Government websites are a big source of informative channels, however, they are confusing or not interactive. The user experience is not kept in mind since their purpose is to simply inform and spit out information that is relevant.

Our service would take into consideration the user's need and stages of transition. The user would be provided with a backoffice and personalized information relevant to the stage they are in now. Whether it is a prospective student or if it's someone who has been here a year or two, Quickimm will be able to pull relevant information for the student to facilitate their transition.
